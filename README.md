<h2>The Home Security solution for Raspberry Pi!</h2>
<br>
<p>This is a student-made project that shows the potential of normal components and mount them into a custom-made home security</p>
<p>The components used are not expensive at all (except for the Raspberry Pi, which might cost you a bit). Sensors like PIR and REED are unexpensive and perfect for this type of project.<br>
You can even use that old webcam of yours for a security camera :)</p>

<h4>Components</h4>
<p>What you need for this project is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Raspberry Pi (whatever module it is, it's fine)</li>
  <li>Some reed sensors (for doors and windows)</li>
  <li>Some PIR sensors (for movements)</li>
  <li>Some USB webcams (optional)</li>
  <li>A 3x4 numpad <b>or</b><br>A TFT screen for the GUI.<br>(You can continue without either, but you will be entirely dependent of the Web GUI.)</li>
  <li><s>Some hot chocolate pie</s></li>
</ul>

<h4>How it works</h4>
<p>This project was made on <b>Python</b>, mostly. <br>There are many python modules for many things, such as cameras, sensor detection, users logging.</p>
<p>You can arm and disarm the system by directly interacting with it (TFT screen or 3x4 keypad) or via WebGUI.</p>
<p>Yes, this project counts with a Web GUI controller that allows you to manage remotely the system directly from your phone. Everything is done on the Web, since state changes, user management, other settings, consulting cameras, etc.</p>
<p>But the keypad is there for a faster interaction in those cases where you need it, so you still have a way of disarming it even if your phone dies ;)</p>

<h4>Downloads</h4>
<p>If you don't want to download it from GitHub, you can download it from here too.<br>
You can either <b>install the components yourself</b> or <b>run the insaller</b>. It's up to you</p>
